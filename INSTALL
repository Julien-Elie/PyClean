The following command will install the PyClean program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST
file for a list of the files installed.

Once installed, a symbolic link needs to be created in the INN's bin/filter
directory.  Assuming the standard locations have been used, the following
commands can be issued:-

cd ~news/bin/filter
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.x/dist-packages/pyclean/pyclean.py filter_innd.py

If you want to tweak the behaviour of PyClean, you'll also need to copy the
pyclean.cfg.sample file from the samples directory of this distribution to the
pyclean directory and rename it pyclean.cfg.  On a standard installation, this
path will be:-

~news/pyclean/etc

Note: The sample file contains all configuration options and their default
settings.  Unless you're changing an option, it's probably best to remark out
the ones you're not changing.

At this point, the following command can be issued to instruct INN to reload
its configuration:-

ctlinnd reload filter.python PyClean initial load

Monitor the pyclean log directory for any errors or warnings.  If something
goes badly wrong, a traceback file will be created in this directory,
containing details of the problem.  Please report this to steve@mixmin.net so I
can resolve the issue.
