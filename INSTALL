The following command will install the PyClean program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST
file for a list of the files installed.

Once installed, a couple of files should be manually copied into the correct
locations.  The filter_innd.py file in bin/filter/filter_innd.py needs to be
replaced with the one included with this distribution.  If you want to tweak
the behaviour of PyClean, you'll also need to copy the pyclean.cfg.sample file
from the samples directory of this distribution to the pyclean directory and
rename it pyclean.cfg.  On a standard installation, this path will be:
/usr/local/news/pyclean/etc

At this point, the following command can be issued to instruct INN to reload
its configuration:
ctlinnd reload filter.python PyClean initial load

Monitor the pyclean log directory for any errors or warnings.  If something
goes badly wrong, a traceback file will be created in this directory,
containing details of the problem.  Please report this to steve@mixmin.net so
I can resolve the issue.
