The following command will install the PyClean program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory.  In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST.in
file for a list of the files installed.

Once installed, a symbolic link needs to be created in the INN's bin/filter
directory.  Assuming the standard locations have been used, the following
commands can be issued:-

cd ~news/bin/filter
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.x/dist-packages/pyclean/pyclean.py filter_innd.py

If you want to tweak the behaviour of PyClean, you'll also need to copy the
pyclean.cfg.sample file from the samples directory of this distribution to the
pyclean directory and rename it pyclean.cfg.  On a standard installation, this
path will be:-

~news/pyclean/etc

The sample file contains all configuration options, remarked out and at their
default settings.  Additional sample files can be found in the same directory.
They aren't obligatory but you'll probably want them in order to tune PyClean's
logging and filtering behaviour.  Unlike the Perl based Cleanfeed, most of
these files are reloaded automatically without needing a reload of the Python
filter.

At this point, the following command can be issued to instruct INN to reload
its configuration:-

ctlinnd reload filter.python PyClean initial load

Monitor the pyclean log directory for any errors or warnings.  If something
goes badly wrong, a traceback file will be created in this directory,
containing details of the problem.  Please report this to steve@mixmin.net so I
can try to resolve the issue.
