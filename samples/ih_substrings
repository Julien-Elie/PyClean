# Default location: /usr/local/news/pyclean/etc/ih_substrings

# Entries in this file account for single service providers that use multiple
# injection-hosts.  Unlike other PyClean config files, these are plaintext
# substring matches, not Regular Expressions.
#
# A good example is googlegroups.com who have many injection-hosts, formatted
# as 123.xyz.googlegroups.com.  As each entry matches googlegroups.com, the
# substring is substituted as the key for each relevant EMP filter.
